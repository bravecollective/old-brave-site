        You can fly whatever you want, but it's recommended you stick to <a href="https://doctrineships.com/A/1/gifbaj">corporate approved doctrines</a> for a couple reasons.  One is that you may get reimbursed by brave when you get blown up!  This is called the ship reimbursement program (SRP), and we'll come back to that soon.

		<h1 class="mainBullet">If you are in a fleet and need help/have something tackled/etc you need to be as descriptive as possible.</h1>

<span style="color:red">bad: </span>
<ul>
<li>I am scrammed! (And then ignore any requests for more information)</li>
<li>Warp to me! (Without telling why)</li>
<li>Need help! (with what?)</li>
</ul>

<span style="color:green">Good/better: </span>
<ul>
<li>Scrammed by 2 war targets in <insert ship types>. I fly a <insert ship type>. <i>If you are on voice comms add:</i>I have put xxx in fleet. </li>
<li>I have a war target in a <ship type> tackled near <gate/planet/asteroid belt/Station>. <number>/no war targets in system.</li>
</ul>

These are just a few examples. In the heat of battle it might be hard to type that much information, but any good FC will ask about this anyway. So if you are able to give it right away it will actually get you support quicker. 
In fact in a lot of cases a fleet will not help someone out that does not give information. The reason for that is simple, we don't know if there is one ship on your or 50 so blindly warping in more people is very likely to get more people killed.
		<h1 class="mainBullet">If you're in a fleet that's more than "dessie down" or "frigates only", DO NOT BROADCAST FOR REPS.</h1>
                When you're in a frigate or destroyer in a big fleet, (10-20 million) you likely also have Cruisers/Battlecruisers/Battleships with you. In large fleets frigates are too hard to lock and will likely die before logi can get to them plus it takes away from larger ships. You broadcast, one of those Cruisers/Battlecruisers/Battleships dies. For perspective, your Destroyer costs 10-20 million isk (a lot to you maybe, yes) But the Battleship doctrine we have, costs 200 million+</br></br>
				If you're in a small ship, in a big fleet, you get locked, you warp out to whatever you're aligned, and warp back in.</br>
				There are a few logi that will add groups of frigates and destroyers to their watch list and will heal you if you get lucky, so hope isn't all lost.  We just don't want 5 logi dropping other locks and locking a frigate that's already dead.</br>
		<h1 class="mainBullet">Find your first fleet!</h1>
				Watch alliance chat for a minute to see when the next frigate fleet is forming up. If you don't see it mentioned after a minute or two, feel free to ask. It's probably worth asking if they can provide you with a ship too! (It will be fitted for you.) If you prefer to buy your own ships, there are completely fitted sets often containing several copies of a ship if you click the E on the top left corner of your screen > Business > Contracts > Available Contracts Tab. Be sure the location is your current station! There should always be plenty in Sendaya. You don't even need to bring a ship.
