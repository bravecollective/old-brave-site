<strong>Core skills</strong>
<div style="font-size:small;">by Creesch</div> <br />Ok, you might already have come across skill plans for new players. But that is usually a long list of skills you are told to put in EVEMon and just train for. <br />Because of that and because they don&#39;t seem to offer a direct benefit (why should I train for a skill that gives me 5% of something I don&#39;t even understand yet if I can also train for that shiny cruiser?) I see a lot of people neglecting skills that are actually very important. Below I have listed several groups of core skills I personally believe every player should be aware of and train towards. This doesn&#39;t mean that you have to stop all other training in favor of these skills! It is absolutely fine to train for your frigate and modules you want to fit on that frigate first. You should however be aware that the skills below benefit <u>all</u> ships you&#39;ll fly in EVE, even those you have not trained for yet.  <br /><br /><u>Engineering </u> <br /><ul><li>Capacitor Management - <em>You don&#39;t want to run out of cap during a fight do you? </em></li><li>Capacitor Systems Operation - <em>Increase cap recharge, be able to fit boosters.</em></li><li>Weapon Upgrades - <em>Be able to fit those shiny guns. </em></li><li>Advanced Weapon Upgrades - <em>Even more shiny.</em></li><li>CPU Management - <em>1% cpu short? Nope not anymore.</em></li><li>Power Grid Management - <em>Never not enough juice to fit stuff. </em></li><li>Thermodynamics - <em>Overheat those modules!</em></li></ul>These skills will be useful for <em><u>all</u></em> ships you will fly in EVE. They either help you with being able to fit that awesome fit or last longer in the field because you have more cap, can overheat your modules, etc. <br /><br /><u>Navigation</u> in EVE you&#39;ll survive if you can align faster, move faster and warp faster. These skills will help you with that<br /><ul><li>Acceleration Control - <em>Be faster!</em></li><li>Evasive Maneuvering - <em>Align (and therefore warp) faster!</em></li><li>Navigation - <em>Be even faster!</em></li><li>Warp Drive Operation - <em>Don&#39;t drop out of long warps anymore.</em></li></ul><br /><br /><u>Targeting</u> In a lot of roams with longer range ships you&#39;ll find people not being able to target baddies because their targeting can&#39;t reach that far, don&#39;t be that guy ;). As a new player you usually will be flying small fast tackle, you&#39;ll want to be able to lock that target as soon as possible. In other cases you&#39;ll find yourself jammed where only holding lock for a few more seconds would have gotten you that kill. <br /><br /><ul><li>Signature Analysis - <em>lock &#39;m up fast.</em></li><li>Racial Sensor Compensation - <em>Every race has a specific sort visible in the attributes of your ship. Train the one for the ships you fly most first.</em></li><li>Long range targeting - <em>lock &#39;m up from afar. </em></li><li>Target Management - <em>Lock that entire blob! </em></li></ul><br /><u>Shields</u> <br /><ul><li>Shield Management -  <em>Useful for everyone, even if you don&#39;t have shield tanked ships. It gives you a slightly better buffer. </em></li><li><em>The skills below are for people flying shield tanked ships.</em></li><li>EM Shield Compensation</li><li>Kinetic Shield Compensation</li><li>Explosive Shield Compensation</li><li>Thermic Shield Compensation</li><li>Shield Compensation</li></ul><br /><u>Armor</u><br /><ul><li>Hull upgrades -  <em>Just like Shield Management, gives you a bit of a extra buffer.</em></li><li>Mechanics -  <em>One last bit of buffer on structure level. </em></li><li><em>The skills below are for people flying armor tanked ships.</em></li><li>EM Armor Compensation</li><li>Explosive Armor Compensation</li><li>Thermic Armor Compensation</li><li>Kinetic Armor Compensation</li><li>Armor Layering</li></ul><br /><u>Gunnery</u> Useful for three of the four weapon systems usually found on ships in EVE. <br /><ul><li>Motion Prediction - <em>Helps you with pesky targets like our undock teacher.</em></li><li>Rapid Firing - <em>Kill them faster.</em></li><li>Sharpshooter - <em>Hit them from farther away. </em></li><li>Trajectory Analysis - <em>Hit them from farther away with accuracy.</em></li><li>Surgical Strike - <em>Hit &#39;m where it hurts.</em></li><li>Controlled Burst - <em>Don&#39;t let guns empty your cap (applies mostly to lasers and secondly to hybrids).</em></li></ul><br /><u>Missiles</u> The fourth weapon system which has its own set of core skills. <br /><ul><li>Missile Bombardment - <em>Hit them from farther away. </em></li><li>Missile Projection -  <em>Hit them from even farther away. </em></li><li>Rapid launch - <em>Kill them faster.</em></li><li>Target Navigation Prediction - <em>Hit faster moving targets.</em></li><li>Warhead upgrades - <em>Hit &#39;m harder.</em></li></ul><br />I am going to wrap it up right here, For a lot of the skills I mentioned in these lists there are also advanced versions. I did not list them because I believe that at the time you get to those you should be able to figure that out for yourself ;) In any case if you have trained the listed skills you effectively have created a very good starting point for any ship you decide to train towards. It is still a smart idea to focus your training on specific ships and weapons, however if you have trained the core skills it enables you to cross train to pretty much any other race without having to start at zero. So for example: You are a mostly Gallente trained pilot with good core skills and you decide to switch to caldari frigates (because, crow!)? Well as soon as you have trained caldari frigate I you are able to outrun, warp, etc that caldari player that just started playing two weeks ago. <br /><br />For bigger/advanced ships these skills are <strong>Essential</strong>! Don&#39;t even think about stepping into a t2 ship or battleship if you don&#39;t have these core skills trained to a acceptable level. You probably can and many of you will, but that will most likely result in you losing costly ships because you were not able to fit or fly them properly yet.
