	<p>Ok, you might already have come across skill plans for new players.
    But that is usually a long list of skills you are told to put in EVEMon and
    just train for.</p>
    <p>Because of that and because they don't seem to offer a direct benefit (why
    should I train for a skill that gives me 5% of something I don't even
    understand yet if I can also train for that shiny cruiser?) I see a lot of
    people neglecting skills that are actually very important. Below I have
    listed several groups of core skills I personally believe every player
    should be aware of and train towards. This doesn't mean that you have to
    stop all other training in favor of these skills! It is absolutely fine to
    train for your frigate and modules you want to fit on that frigate first.
    You should however be aware that the skills below benefit <span style=
    "text-decoration: underline">all</span> ships you'll fly in EVE, even those
    you have not trained for yet.</p>

    <h3><span style="text-decoration: underline">Engineering</span></h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Capacitor Management - <em>You don't want to run out of cap during
        a fight do you?</em></li>

        <li>Capacitor Systems Operation - <em>Increase cap recharge, be able to
        fit boosters.</em></li>

        <li>Weapon Upgrades - <em>Be able to fit those shiny guns.</em></li>

        <li>Advanced Weapon Upgrades - <em>Even more shiny.</em></li>

        <li>CPU Management - <em>1% cpu short? Nope not anymore.</em></li>

        <li>Power Grid Management - <em>Never not enough juice to fit
        stuff.</em></li>

        <li>Thermodynamics - <em>Overheat those modules!</em></li>
    </ul>These skills will be useful for <em style=
    "text-decoration: underline">all</em> ships you will fly in EVE. They
    either help you with being able to fit that awesome fit or last longer in
    the field because you have more cap, can overheat your modules, etc.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline">Navigation</span> in EVE you'll
    survive if you can align faster, move faster and warp faster. These skills
    will help you with that<br>

    <ul>
        <li>Acceleration Control - <em>Be faster!</em></li>

        <li>Evasive Maneuvering - <em>Align (and therefore warp)
        faster!</em></li>

        <li>Navigation - <em>Be even faster!</em></li>

        <li>Warp Drive Operation - <em>Don't drop out of long warps
        anymore.</em></li>
    </ul><br>
    <br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline">Targeting</span> In a lot of roams
    with longer range ships you'll find people not being able to target baddies
    because their targeting can't reach that far, don't be that guy ;). As a
    new player you usually will be flying small fast tackle, you'll want to be
    able to lock that target as soon as possible. In other cases you'll find
    yourself jammed where only holding lock for a few more seconds would have
    gotten you that kill.<br>
    <br>

    <ul>
        <li>Signature Analysis - <em>lock 'm up fast.</em></li>

        <li>Racial Sensor Compensation - <em>Every race has a specific sort
        visible in the attributes of your ship. Train the one for the ships you
        fly most first.</em></li>

        <li>Long range targeting - <em>lock 'm up from afar.</em></li>

        <li>Target Management - <em>Lock that entire blob!</em></li>
    </ul><br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline">Shields</span><br>

    <ul>
        <li>Shield Management - <em>Useful for everyone, even if you don't have
        shield tanked ships. It gives you a slightly better buffer.</em></li>

        <li><em>The skills below are for people flying shield tanked
        ships.</em></li>

        <li>EM Shield Compensation</li>

        <li>Kinetic Shield Compensation</li>

        <li>Explosive Shield Compensation</li>

        <li>Thermic Shield Compensation</li>

        <li>Shield Compensation</li>
    </ul><br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline">Armor</span><br>

    <ul>
        <li>Hull upgrades - <em>Just like Shield Management, gives you a bit of
        a extra buffer.</em></li>

        <li>Mechanics - <em>One last bit of buffer on structure
        level.</em></li>

        <li><em>The skills below are for people flying armor tanked
        ships.</em></li>

        <li>EM Armor Compensation</li>

        <li>Explosive Armor Compensation</li>

        <li>Thermic Armor Compensation</li>

        <li>Kinetic Armor Compensation</li>

        <li>Armor Layering</li>
    </ul><br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline">Gunnery</span> Useful for three of
    the four weapon systems usually found on ships in EVE.<br>

    <ul>
        <li>Motion Prediction - <em>Helps you with pesky targets like our
        undock teacher.</em></li>

        <li>Rapid Firing - <em>Kill them faster.</em></li>

        <li>Sharpshooter - <em>Hit them from farther away.</em></li>

        <li>Trajectory Analysis - <em>Hit them from farther away with
        accuracy.</em></li>

        <li>Surgical Strike - <em>Hit 'm where it hurts.</em></li>

        <li>Controlled Burst - <em>Don't let guns empty your cap (applies
        mostly to lasers and secondly to hybrids).</em></li>
    </ul><br>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline">Missiles</span> The fourth weapon
    system which has its own set of core skills.<br>

    <ul>
        <li>Missile Bombardment - <em>Hit them from farther away.</em></li>

        <li>Missile Projection - <em>Hit them from even farther away.</em></li>

        <li>Rapid launch - <em>Kill them faster.</em></li>

        <li>Target Navigation Prediction - <em>Hit faster moving
        targets.</em></li>

        <li>Warhead upgrades - <em>Hit 'm harder.</em></li>
    </ul><br>
    I am going to wrap it up right here, For a lot of the skills I mentioned in
    these lists there are also advanced versions. I did not list them because I
    believe that at the time you get to those you should be able to figure that
    out for yourself ;) In any case if you have trained the listed skills you
    effectively have created a very good starting point for any ship you decide
    to train towards. It is still a smart idea to focus your training on
    specific ships and weapons, however if you have trained the core skills it
    enables you to cross train to pretty much any other race without having to
    start at zero. So for example: You are a mostly Gallente trained pilot with
    good core skills and you decide to switch to caldari frigates (because,
    crow!)? Well as soon as you have trained caldari frigate I you are able to
    outrun, warp, etc that caldari player that just started playing two weeks
    ago.<br>
    <br>
    For bigger/advanced ships these skills are <strong>Essential</strong>!
    Don't even think about stepping into a t2 ship or battleship if you don't
    have these core skills trained to a acceptable level. You probably can and
    many of you will, but that will most likely result in you losing costly
    ships because you were not able to fit or fly them properly yet.
