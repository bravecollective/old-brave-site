				You'll need it for accessing nearly any brave information, including links from this guide indicated by a lock icon and joining your first fleet.</br>

			<h2 class="mainBullet">Start training skills!</h2>
			<ul>				
				<li>Your tutorial missions will probably have you start training something. Good all-around <i>basic</i> skills that everyone should have include Navigation III, CPU Management III, Afterburner III, and Power Grid Management III. </li>
				<li><a href="basicskills.html">A brief guide to other skills you want to train can be found here.</a></li>				
				<li>The skill plans <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bravenewbies/comments/23ki3q/dojo_the_official_brave_skill_plan_v1_for_your/" class="insecure">here</a> will go more in depth and give you some options to train for the <a href="https://doctrineships.com/A/1/gifbaj">doctrines</a> (types of ships) Brave prefers.</li> 
				<li>Brave also runs a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/1jFDEVS.jpg">free skillbook program.</a>  Though they do ask that you don't request more than a few days of books at a time.  <a href="https://forums.braveineve.com/dg/531bbb7358b70003566717bc" class="secure">List of skillbooks and more info.</a></li>			
			</ul>
			
			<h2 class="mainBullet">Unfuck your overview! </h2>
				Follow <a href="overviewsetup.html">the instructions found in this link</a>.</br>
				This ensures that you don't shoot friendlies, and you can tell when it's safe to shoot enemies.  <b>It's important.</b></br>
							
			<h2 class="mainBullet">Come out to Sendaya!</h2>
				You could die on the way.  If you're in a frigate, shuttle, or pod, you'll <i>probably</i> be fine.  The best way to experience eve is to dive in head first.  You don't have that much to lose at this point anyway.  Just make sure you have a clone (and if you did the tutorial missions, it would have walked you through this). Be sure to read the insta-dock section.</br>

			<h2 class="mainBullet">Insta-dock/undock</h2>
				Stations are large.  Often, right clicking a station and selecting warp to 0 still won't put you quite within range of the station dock.  It can put you as far as 10km out, which is plenty of time for someone to lock onto you and blow you up. Similarly, when you undock and select "warp to...", it takes a moment for your ship to align to that place before you warp.  Again, this is enough time for someone to lock you and blow you up.  <br /><br />Fortunately, there are rather simple ways around this.  To access these menus, just right click an empty area of space.  It can be advisable to make your own insta-dock and undock bookmarks as well.  Often, people will know where our corporate undock bookmarks are set and wait there for you.  This is why there are so many options in the insta-undock bookmarks for Sendaya.  Just pick one at random (or better yet, make your own).  Be sure to dock at the station <i>as soon as</i> you land at the insta-undock bookmark.<br />

			<h2 class="mainBullet">Join Jabber (optional but recommended) <a href="http://imgur.com/a/vVkW2#0">How To</a></h2>
				This is a generic IM client which will send you notifications when fleets are forming up and big things are happening.</br>
				It's also worth turning off join and leave channel messages. <a href="https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/Using%20Pidgin#hide-joins-parts">How To</a></br>
			
			<h2 class="mainBullet">Turn off CSPA charges - <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DSxBlsk.gif">How To</a></h2>
				This is an anti-spam measure that will annoy your friends or anyone trying to help/talk to you.  It's a fee to start a conversation with you, and it's really unnecessary.</br>
			
			<h2 class="mainBullet">Newbie's First Fleet</h2>
				Feel free to do whatever you like at this point.  If you're looking for something to do, <a href="newbiesfirstfleet.html">read this and join your first fleet!</a> You don't even need to bring a ship.</br>
			
			<h2 class="mainBullet">How to ask questsions</h2>
				First, check the <a href="bravefaq.html">Brave FAQ</a></br>
				Second, spend at least 15 seconds googling.</br>
				Third, ask in the Brave Dojo channel. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/K7zFS2o.gif">How to join a chat channel</a></br>
			
			<h2 class="mainBullet">Don't worry about hauling your stuff</h2>
				Frankly, your stuff weighs more than it's worth paying someone to carry it.  Leave it all behind besides the ship you're flying in and some ammo. If you find you really need it later, you can always go back for it.</br>
				If you really know what you're doing, and you're certain you want stuff hauled, see our <a href="http://freight.braveineve.com">hauling page</a> and associated <a href="http://freight.braveineve.com/faq.html">FAQ</a></br>
			
			<h2 class="mainBullet">Do not, I repeat, do not use corp mail.</h2>
				We have several thousand people in the corp, if everyone spammed corp mail for every little thing it would turn into a mess very quickly.</br>
			
			<h2 class="mainBullet">Check Alliance Bulletins <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0EDjpEH.png">How To</a></h2>
				There may be more updated information there than what is in this guide.</br>
			
			<h2 class="mainBullet">Brave Leadership</h2>
				If you want to contact a specific department of Brave, you can contact anyone here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Mp-PQvKhGNlkHJGAAe3vnCXagiQrckBU06z5Wr1HMbU/edit?pli=1">BNI Structure</a> (Slightly out of date.  Will be updated soon.)
